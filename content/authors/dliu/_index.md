Di Liu graduated from New York University in 2020 with a PhD in Physics. His current research interests focus on strong-field QED (SFQED), particularly on how photons and electrically charged particles interact with strong electromagnetic backgrounds. Di is also interested in applying approximation methods such as the local monochromatic approximation (LMA) and locally constant field approximation (LCFA) to support numerical simulations and deepen our understanding of SFQED. Before joining Plymouth, Di also conducted research into various areas of high-energy physics, including dark matter models and detection, Standard Model Effective Field Theory, the Higgs boson naturalness problem, and Cosmology.

Anthony has a sustained interest in strong-field quantum electrodynamics (QED). His first research interests were focused on the behaviour of charges in extreme electromagnetic fields, often created by high intensity lasers. Using theory and numerical tools, principally particle-in-cell codes, Anthony studies how to create significant numbers of electron-positron pairs using laser beams and how to manipulate them in cascades and 'avalanches'. Since being in Plymouth, Anthony has focussed on applying QED theory to strong-field processes such as photon-photon scattering.
